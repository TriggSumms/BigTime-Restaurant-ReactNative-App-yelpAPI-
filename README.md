## :raising_hand: Currently working on Heroku Deployment...

#### :hammer: Build it yourself

Run the following commands:

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/TriggSumms/BigTime-Restaurant-ReactNative-App-yelpAPI-.git and cd BigTimeRestaurantApppp
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the app with Expo
...make sure your currently in the BigTimeRestaurantApppp folder
npm start
```

```
# *The Yelp API is fully integrated...so interaction should start after the app builds. 

```

The [Expo](https://expo.io) packager will show, and you can either:


-   install the Expo app, scan the displayed QR code, and run the app on your mobile phone directly.
-   open the Android simulator.
-   open the iOS simulator.
